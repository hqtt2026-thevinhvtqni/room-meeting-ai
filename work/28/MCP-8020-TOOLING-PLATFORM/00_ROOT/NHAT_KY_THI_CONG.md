# WORK 28 — NHẬT KÝ THI CÔNG / WORK EXECUTION JOURNAL

**Canonical journal:** This is the only Work-wide execution journal for Work 28.  
**Repository:** `hqtt2026-thevinhvtqni/room-meeting-ai`  
**Branch:** `work/28-mcp-tooling-platform`

## 2026-11-03 — JRN-W28-001 — Governance and GitHub-first restart

**Instruction:** Vinh delegated end-to-end coordination and requested a four-AI team, GitHub-first delivery and minimal PC involvement.

**READ / TRACE**
- Confirmed repository and branch exist; branch HEAD at initial inspection: `a652c49fdc738424a27c6408b386df2dd1af4540`.
- Read current Work 28 manifest, continuation plan, architecture plan, CI workflow, process lifecycle implementation and related tests.
- Found governance drift: the GitHub manifest still assigned Ka as execution lead, treated MCP :8020 as the active AI-facing interface, and prohibited AI GitHub commits/pushes. These statements conflict with the current approved direction.
- Found the current Windows process lifecycle code starts the process before attempting Job Object attachment. The execution path checks the gate after spawn and then attempts cleanup if attachment is missing. This does not yet prove that no command can run before containment is established.
- Confirmed GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/work28-mcp-tooling.yml` has Linux and Windows jobs and is configured for pushes to the Work 28 branch, pull requests and manual dispatch.

**DECIDE**
- GitHub branch `work/28-mcp-tooling-platform` is canonical for code and controlled documents.
- Team is restricted to Xu, Vi, Ka and An; Co excluded.
- Preserve MCP :8030 as Build/Verification lane. Quarantine the historical MCP :8020 listener; do not interact with it. Rebuild Runtime MCP independently.
- Keep Core :8000 as sole authorization/application authority; Execution Host :8031 remains the controlled execution boundary.
- Keep Work status ACTIVE / INTEGRATION BLOCKED / NOT RELEASED and Execution Gate CLOSED.

**BUILD**
- Updated `00_ROOT/WORK_MANIFEST.md` on GitHub to reflect the new authority, team, source-of-truth and architecture rules.
- Commit returned by GitHub: `57d6643f6e5c00849dffff72380aaf59fcbf8b93`.

**VERIFY**
- GitHub API confirmed the manifest update commit was created on the requested branch.
- This is documentation persistence evidence only. No code test, CI result, live runtime test, independent AI acknowledgement or product acceptance is claimed.

**NEXT**
- Add canonical minutes, journal, document register, master execution plan and architecture decision to GitHub.
- Trace the full current code/runtime surface and reconcile old Work 28 reports as evidence.
- Vi: implement only after reading the master plan and exact current branch state.
- Ka: independently review architecture and code changes.
- An: independently reproduce CI and targeted security/lifecycle tests.
- Xu: integrate findings, resolve within delegated authority, maintain blockers and release gate.

## Journal rules
Each entry must include date, task/decision ID, READ/TRACE evidence, action, changed paths/commit, tests and results, unresolved blockers, and next owner. Do not record an assignment as completed work. Never label a run PASS without its actual output.


## 2026-11-03 — JRN-W28-002 — GitHub controlled-document baseline published

**BUILD**
- Published the canonical minutes register: commit `96785335115689f3ef8e8b710968e9131509e7ff`.
- Published the Work-wide journal: commit `2e1f35f8ea91ad2d92c2e8a3137e1206a20c47cc`.
- Published Work 70-aligned structure standard: commit `cf8fe601572777867f4382e753994f3cfa6b5542`.
- Published controlled document register: commit `58811ab648defbff90af56b82501ea7d5b7f39f2`.
- Published master execution plan V2.0: commit `a2c1a2af7f4cf3ca3872551fdb0cfd8771e7a26c`.
- Published architecture decision V2: commit `3f8dcc8e9ac26ec792da7ab2dfdf70156485e40c`.
- Updated Work 28 entry README: commit `236b3e9b5615eff8001ec4da06cdfc1c20eb28ab`.

**VERIFY**
- Read back all eight canonical files from GitHub; contents and blob SHAs were returned successfully.
- Branch HEAD verified as `236b3e9b5615eff8001ec4da06cdfc1c20eb28ab`; compare from initial HEAD `a652c49fdc738424a27c6408b386df2dd1af4540` reports 8 commits ahead and 0 behind.
- GitHub Actions run #265 for commit `3f8dcc8e9ac26ec792da7ab2dfdf70156485e40c` completed SUCCESS. This confirms the configured workflow completed successfully for that commit; it does not verify the later README commit or runtime/product acceptance.
- GitHub Actions run #266 for HEAD `236b3e9b5615eff8001ec4da06cdfc1c20eb28ab` was IN_PROGRESS at the last check. Do not mark it PASS until a completed result is read.

**LIMITATION / BLOCKER**
- The GitHub commit history and file readbacks prove document persistence, not dispatch/acknowledgement by Vi, Ka or An.
- No code implementation was changed in this documentation checkpoint.
- Work 28 remains ACTIVE / INTEGRATION BLOCKED / NOT RELEASED; Execution Gate remains CLOSED.


## 2026-11-03 — JRN-W28-003 — Latest documentation commit CI completed

- **Commit:** `17a556b4570e42ee759ea7ece2fc19f19ed216ea`.
- **GitHub Actions run:** #267 — `41548184850`.
- **Conclusion:** SUCCESS.
- **Jobs:** `unit-regression-tests` PASS; `execution-host-lifecycle-linux` PASS; `execution-host-lifecycle-windows` PASS.
- **Scope:** the repository's currently configured Work 28 unit/regression and lifecycle suites on the exact commit above.
- **Interpretation:** this confirms the current configured CI suites pass on Linux and Windows. It does not prove live MCP 8030 provenance, new Runtime MCP deployment, Core E2E, pre-execution Windows containment, OS sandbox isolation, independent Ka review, or release acceptance.
- **Work status:** ACTIVE / INTEGRATION BLOCKED / NOT RELEASED. Execution Gate CLOSED.
